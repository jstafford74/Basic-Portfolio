       <p><img src="assets/images/J2_crop_small.jpg" alt="Jeremiah Stafford" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin:10px 15px;">Born and raised on Air Force Bases, my parents are both retired Air Force officers, veterans and met working at Cheyenne Mountain Air Station in Colorado.  As a finance graduate of the Carrol School of Management at Boston College, I immediately pursued a career in finance with a focus in derivatives.  Having worked on the open-outcry trading floors, at hedge funds and sell-side institutions I have interacted in numerous market structures, environments and asset classes.  Financial risk management has always been a focus, from plain vanilla market risk to the more complex world of derivatives that span market, credit and interest rates. 
      
        In 2017 I started working with a medical device startup company that is focused on noninvasive ways to detect blood glucose, and am currently working as a business development lead, project manager and data analyst for a dermatologist practice in Stamford, CT that is also focused on noninvasive solutions to treat skin cancer.</p>
